=head1 NAME

POE::Filter::Line - serialize and parse terminated records (lines)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!perl

  use POE qw(Wheel::FollowTail Filter::Line);

  POE::Session->create(
    inline_states => {
      _start => sub {
        $_[HEAP]{tailor} = POE::Wheel::FollowTail->new(
          Filename => "/var/log/system.log",
          InputEvent => "got_log_line",
          Filter => POE::Filter::Line->new(),
        );
      },
      got_log_line => sub {
        print "Log: $_[ARG0]\n";
      }
    }
  );

  POE::Kernel->run();
  exit;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Filter::Line parses stream data into terminated records.  The
default parser interprets newlines as the record terminator, and the
default serializer appends network newlines (CR/LF, or "\x0D\x0A") to
outbound records.

Record terminators are removed from the data POE::Filter::Line
returns.

POE::Filter::Line supports a number of other ways to parse lines.
Constructor parameters may specify literal newlines, regular
expressions, or that the filter should detect newlines on its own.

=head1 PUBLIC FILTER METHODS

POE::Filter::Line's new() method has some interesting parameters.

=head2 new

new() accepts a list of named parameters.

In all cases, the data interpreted as the record terminator is
stripped from the data POE::Filter::Line returns.

C<InputLiteral> may be used to parse records that are terminated by
some literal string.  For example, POE::Filter::Line may be used to
parse and emit C-style lines, which are terminated with an ASCII NUL:

  my $c_line_filter = POE::Filter::Line->new(
    InputLiteral => chr(0),
    OutputLiteral => chr(0),
  );

C<OutputLiteral> allows a filter to put() records with a different
record terminator than it parses.  This can be useful in applications
that must translate record terminators.

C<Literal> is a shorthand for the common case where the input and
output literals are identical.  The previous example may be written
as:

  my $c_line_filter = POE::Filter::Line->new(
    Literal => chr(0),
  );

An application can also allow POE::Filter::Line to figure out which
newline to use.  This is done by specifying C<InputLiteral> to be
undef:

  my $whichever_line_filter = POE::Filter::Line->new(
    InputLiteral => undef,
    OutputLiteral => "\n",
  );

C<InputRegexp> may be used in place of C<InputLiteral> to recognize
line terminators based on a regular expression. Please make sure the regexp
is a sane one and doesn't capture anything in order to boost performance!

In this example, input is terminated by two or more consecutive newlines.
On output, the paragraph separator is "---" on a line by itself.

  my $paragraph_filter = POE::Filter::Line->new(
    InputRegexp => "[\x0D\x0A]{2,}",
    OutputLiteral => "\n---\n",
  );

C<MaxBuffer> sets the maximum amount of data that the filter will hold onto 
while trying to find a line ending.  Defaults to 512 MB.

C<MaxLength> sets the maximum length of a line.  Defaults to 64 MB.

If either the C<MaxLength> or C<MaxBuffer> constraint is exceeded,
C<POE::Filter::Line> will throw an exception.


=head1 PUBLIC FILTER METHODS

POE::Filter::Line has no additional public methods.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

POE::Filter::Line exports the FIRST_UNUSED constant.  This points to
the first unused element in the $self array reference.  Subclasses
should store their own data beginning here, and they should export
their own FIRST_UNUSED constants to help future subclassers.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Please see L<POE::Filter> for documentation regarding the base
interface.

The SEE ALSO section in L<POE> contains a table of contents covering
the entire POE distribution.

=head1 BUGS

The default input newline parser is a regexp that has an unfortunate
race condition.  First the regular expression:

  /(\x0D\x0A?|\x0A\x0D?)/

While it quickly recognizes most forms of newline, it can sometimes
detect an extra blank line.  This happens when a two-byte newline
character is broken between two reads.  Consider this situation:

  some stream dataCR
  LFother stream data

The regular expression will see the first CR without its corresponding
LF.  The filter will properly return "some stream data" as a line.
When the next packet arrives, the leading "LF" will be treated as the
terminator for a 0-byte line.  The filter will faithfully return this
empty line.

B<It is advised to specify literal newlines or use the autodetect
feature in applications where blank lines are significant.>
