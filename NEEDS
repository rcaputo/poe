# This is a rules file for tagging modules in this distribution as
# "core" or "extension".  Every rule is applied to every module, in
# order, and the final values are applied to each module.
#
# Module tagging rules are in the form:
#
#   module-mask is (core|extension|data)
#
# Dependency tagging rules are in the form:
#
#   module-mask (wants|needs) dependent-mask
#
# Core modules must be able to load all their "needed" dependencies.
# The program exits with a failure code (designed to stop a makefile)
# if any of the distribution's core modules requires a dependent that
# can't be loaded.
#
# Data modules are ignored.
#
# All other module/need combinations generate appropriate warnings.

# POE is mostly extensions with a few core modules.  Dependencies are
# "hard" by default.  Modules are extensions by default.

* needs *
* is extension

# Core modules are the exception.  Set them explicitly.  "Data" files
# are ignored.
